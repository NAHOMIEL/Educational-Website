# CurioKid
🚀 I just created CurioKid — an educational website designed to spark curiosity and creativity in children!..with a focus on fun, simplicity, and interactive learning, CurioKid aims to make education engaging and accessible for young minds.
This project challenged me to think like a kid while building like a developer — from crafting colorful UI to integrating playful content that makes learning exciting. It’s a step toward my dream of using tech to make a positive impact in education.
